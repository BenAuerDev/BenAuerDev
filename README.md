- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenAuerDev
- from 🇦🇹
- living in Berlin 🇩🇪 

I love everything open source! Try to contribute as much as my schedule allows.

I helped build [Flites](https://github.com/marqably/flites) a sprite generator built with Flutter. I also built [Flashlist](https://github.com/Flashlist/flashlist) in public and shared findings on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ben.auer.dev)

Holla at me if you know good tech-meetups in Berlin.
